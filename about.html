        <p class="bio-text">
          Andrea Pasqua was born in Treviso in 1989. He studied Architecture, Construction and Conservation at IUAV University of Venice, where he graduated in 2016.
        </p>
        
        <p class="bio-text">
          Over the years, he worked with different architecture studios in Italy, the Netherlands (Rotterdam), and China, gaining experience across diverse cultural and design contexts.
        </p>
        
        <p class="bio-text">
          In 2025, he opened his own studio in Guangzhou, continuing his work in architecture and visual design. His approach combines a strong interest in space, nature, people and atmosphere, shaped by a minimal aesthetic and a focus on clarity and balance.
        </p>
        
        <p class="bio-text">
          Alongside his professional path, Andrea has studied Taijiquan, a traditional Chinese martial art. The discipline’s core ideas—balance, full and empty, adaptability—have deeply influenced the way he thinks about architecture, encouraging a design process that values flow, structural tension, and intentional simplicity.
        </p>
        
        <p class="bio-text">
          His work reflects a careful attention to materials, light, and the in-between. He believes in reuse, sustainability, and the ability of space to quietly shape the way we feel and live.
